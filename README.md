# CTF-Util
 Minetest CSM that contains a few cool utilities for Capture The Flag by Rubenwardy and LandarVargan


 1. You can block players using .block and .unblock, you can also show all blocked players by doing .list_blocked.

 2. You can see other people using the utility mod. This can be disabled by typing .toggle_show_ctf_util

 3. There is a built in donate cooldown timer that displays on the right of your screen. Upon donating it counts down to when you can next donate. This can be disabled by typing .toggle_donate_counter.

 4. You can modify the custom tag added to other ctf util users by typing .set_message followed by the message you want. It can only be one word.
