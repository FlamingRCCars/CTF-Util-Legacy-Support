# CTF-Util
 Minetest CSM that contains a few cool utilities for Capture The Flag by Rubenwardy and LandarVargan


 1. You can block players using .block and .unblock

 2. You can see other people using the utility mod. This can be disabled in settings by changing the "Show custom text next to other CTF Util users" setting to false

 3. There is a built in donate cooldown timer that displays on the right of your screen. Upon donating it counts down to when you can next donate.

 4. More features planned.
